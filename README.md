# push_swap Project

## Introduction
The push_swap project is a challenging algorithmic exercise focusing on sorting data with a limited set of instructions and optimizing the number of actions. This project aims to develop proficiency in handling complex algorithms and data structures in C.

## Features
- **Two Stacks Management**: Utilizes two stacks, `a` and `b`, for sorting.
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Implements an efficient algorithm to sort data in ascending order.
- **Instructions Set**: Utilizes a specific set of instructions like `sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`.
- **Error Management**: Handles errors effectively, such as invalid inputs or arguments.
- **Efficiency**: Focuses on reducing the number of operations to sort the stacks.
- **Bonus**: The "checker" program that validates the sorting process was implemented

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2. Compile the program: `make`
3. Run the program: `./push_swap [stack of numbers]`

## Technologies Used
- C programming language
- Algorithmic and data structure concepts
